# 📊 K-Means Clustering Project

This repository contains a complete implementation of the **K-Means Clustering** algorithm using Python and `scikit-learn`. The notebook demonstrates how to perform unsupervised learning for grouping similar data points based on their features.

## 📁 File

- `mlp2.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook with full implementation of K-Means Clustering, including data visualization and evaluation.

## 📌 Features

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Visualizing raw data
- Applying K-Means Clustering with customizable `k` value
- Elbow method to determine optimal `k`
- Cluster visualization with color-coded labels

## ⚙️ Requirements

Install the necessary Python libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
